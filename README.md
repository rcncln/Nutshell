# Express ClickUp Task Creator

This project is a simple Node.js application using Express to create tasks in ClickUp based on incoming webhook data from Nutshell. It listens for POST requests on the `/nutshell-webhook` endpoint, extracts lead information from the request body, and creates a corresponding task in ClickUp.
